# Bach Chorale

Like most melody choralization systems trained on JSB Chorales, DeepChoir can reproduce the style of Bach. This is an example of a rechoralization of **Helft mir Gotts Güte preisen** (A thanksgiving and prayer for the new year), where the alto, tenor and bass are generated by DeepChoir (harmonicity=0.5, polyphonicity=0.5).

# Famous Tune
To give you a better understanding of what DeepChoir is capable of, we further rechoralized a famous melody, **Twinkle Twinkle Little Star**. We manually harmonized this melody to a Baroque style chord progression, then choralizing it with a setting of harmonicity=0.4 and polyphonicity=0.6.

Think the above example is too short? The choralized tune given below (harmonicity=0.9, polyphonicity=0.2) is from the world-famous and much-loved game series Mario Bros. Of the six tracks of the Super Mario Bros. soundtrack, this **Overworld Theme** took the most time to develop, according to its composer Koji Kondo. If you listen carefully, you will notice that the chords in bars 15 and 31 are A♭, but DeepChoir gives a B (out of chord) on the strong beat of Tenor part. This also shows where DeepChoir's limitations lie, but overall it is still exciting to achieve such results on modern jazz style music, considering that the system was trained on a Baroque period dataset.

# Folk Song
With chord conditioning and the improved density sampling, DeepChoir is capable of generating music that is different from the typical Bach style. The melody and chord progressions below are taken from the **A and A's Waltz** (ashover1) which is the first British folk song on the [Nottingham Lead Sheet Dataset](https://github.com/sander-wood/autoharmonizer). To demonstrate the improved density sampling capabilities, two different configurations of DeepChoir are used for its choralization.

# Symphony

This symphony is generated by DeepChoir based on **Ave Maria**, whose melody is composed by Charles Gounod, and the piano accompaniment is from Prelude No. 1 in C major, **BWV 846**. This music is a soulful homage to classical music, fulfilled with baroque elements, which was conceived as a genuine collaboration between humans and machines spanning centuries.

This music is created as follows. We first chordify the piano accompaniment part which is composed by J.S. Bach to get its chord progression. DeepChoir then generates a four-part SATB choir based on the extracted chord progression and the melody composed by Gounod. Finally, we rearrange the generated choir into a symphony and name it **AI Maria**.

**AI Maria** is accepted for inclusion in the ICMA Music Showcase 2022 Asia.
